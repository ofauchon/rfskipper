Regression tool for RFSkipper
=============================


"regression" was designed to perform automatic non-regression testing of RFSkipper
core plugins.

It reads RF signal samples from file, and pass them to the RFSkipper plugins. 
The output of the processing is compared to the expected output from the data file. 


Regression tool can also be used for standalone plugin developpement,
when you don't have mcu/board/programmer or if you want to debug. 



/!\ : RFSkipper "regresion" tool is still under heavy developpement /!\
